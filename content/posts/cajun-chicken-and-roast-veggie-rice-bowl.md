**Method**

1. ROAST THE VEGGIES Place the peeled pumpkin, capsicum and zucchini on the oven tray lined with baking paper. Drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss to coat and place on the top shelf of the oven to cook for 20-25 minutes, or until tender.
1. COOK THE RICE While the veggies are cooking, rinse the basmati rice well. Add the water in a medium saucepan and bring to the boil. Add the rice, stir, reduce the heat to low and cover with a lid. Cook for 10 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Remove the pan from the heat and keep covered for another 10 minutes, until the water is absorbed.
1. COOK THE CHICKEN Place the chicken thigh in a medium bowl. Add the Cajun seasoning and a pinch of salt and pepper and toss to coat the chicken. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a medium frying pan over a high heat. Once hot, add the chicken and cook for 2 minutes on each side, or until lightly browned. In the last 8-10 minutes of veggie cooking time, transfer the chicken to the tray with the veggies and place in the oven until cooked through. Slice into 1 cm thick slices.
1. MAKE THE YOGHURT DRIZZLE In a small bowl, combine the Greek yoghurt, garlic, 1/2 tsp of water and a pinch of salt and pepper. Continue to add 1/2 tsp of water at a time until the yoghurt forms a runny dressing that can be drizzled easily.
1. SERVE UP Divide the rice between bowls and top with the Cajun chicken and the roasted vegetables. Drizzle with the yoghurt and sprinkle over the coriander and the pepitas.
