- 1 - 2 kg very coarse rock salt
- 1 packet whole coriander seeds
- 2 packets of dry coriander powder

**Method**

1. Lay the strips of beef onto a tray covered with rock salt and cover the strips of beef with more rock salt. Let the beef sit for 1 hour, this starts the curing process and starts to draw out moisture and blood from the meat
1. Dry toast whole coriander seeds for about 5 min in a dry fry pan over a medium heat. Toss or stir constantly to avoid burning them. Once cool, crush in a mortar and pestle.
1. Mix the crushed coriander seeds with the other dry ingrediants (coriander powder, brown sugar, black pepper and bicarbonate of soda). Set to one side and pour vinegar into a large mixing bowl.
1. Use sharp edge of a large kitchen knife to scrape off as much of the salt off the meat as possible and then run the meat between your fingers to get off any remaining salt
1. Soak individual meat strips in the brown vinegar for about a minute until the meat takes on a whiteish tinge.
1. Remove from vinegar and squeeze between two fingers to remove all excess vinegar and salt. (i.e. squeeze meat with your hand to get rid of as much liquid as possible)
1. Roll meat in the mixed dry spices in a CLEAN bowl. Only use small amounts of your dry mix at a time otherwise it will get "Gluggy"and you will have to make more. You only need a fine even coating on each piece.
1. At this stage you can experiment and sprinkle with chilli flakes or worcestershire sauce for extra flavour
1. Hang in cool dry space until ready. (must be well ventilated with a fan)
1. Depending on size and thickness of meat it should be ready in 3 to 6 days depending on how dry or 'wet' you like you biltong.
1. Scrape off excess dry spice coating before slicing and eating!!! YUM!
