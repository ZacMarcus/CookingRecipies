title: "Best Pancakes"
description: "This makes the most brilliant breakfast or brunch. It’s important to leave the batter to relax for 15 minutes as it will thicken slightly, making for fuller, fluffier pancakes."

Serves: 2 (about 8 pancakes)

**Ingredients**

- 3/4 cup milk
- 2 tbsp white vinegar (lemon juice will work in place of the vinegar to make the bootleg buttermilk)
- 1 cup flour
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 egg
- 2 tbsp butter

**Method**

1. In a small bowl, stir together milk and vinegar. Allow to sit for five minutes. It will look curdled, and that’is normal.
1. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl.
1. Place butter in a small bowl and melt in the microwave. Once melted, crack the egg into the butter and stir with a fork or whisk until well-combined. Pour butter/egg mixture into milk/vinegar mixture and mix again.
1. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients all at once. Gently stir only until all ingredients are uniformly moist. Don’t over mix or the pancakes will be tough.
1. Let the batter sit for 10-15 minutes, so it can really bubble up. Scoop lightly from the top of the batter, and don't stir!
1. Heat a skillet over medium heat, spray with cooking spray, and drop 1/4 cup spoonfuls of batter onto skillet. Cook until bubbles form and pop, then flip and cook the other side.
